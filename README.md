### HANDS ON LAB

Today we will go though a working example of how data sharing can allow you to make better decisions.  We will be going through how to create a policy simulator in order to estimate the impact of changing the cold weather payment policy.

##### Go to the Private Share area to access the private datasets that you will need.  The private share should now be available, if not - let us know!

#### Viewing the data with a notebook


TBA   .... this will be a notebook which will leverage the data in the private share.

#### Creating the Streamlit app.


Run the SQL Script [run sql setup](sql_setup.sql)

Today we will manually add the files needed to run the app using the snowflake UI.  however, in practices it is much easier to leverage Visual Studio Code as demonstrated today.  You may wish to leverage VSCode in the second part of the hackathon.

You can import this SQL script and run all within Snow sight.

Go to the created stage and add the following file:

[home.py](Home.py)
